### ☕ Developing a Plugin

Here's a step by step guide on how to get started developing your own plugin for the TSQPF.

#### Setting up the Project (IntelliJ IDEA)

If you have not cloned this template repository yet, do so by using the following git command somewhere on your computer: ```git clone https://github.com/Teamspeak-Query-Plugin-Framework/tsqpf-plugin-template```

Then open your IDE and wait for everything to properly load. After that, create a new project and copy the content of the plugin template reposiotry into the directory of your IDEs project. Then add the API to your project as a library. In IntelliJ, you can do so by going up to File -> Project Settings, then switch to the Libraries tab and import the API jar. If that was successful, you are all set.
